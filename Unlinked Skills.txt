"Channeling the divine energy of the Morninglord, the Dervish undergoes a transformation, becoming more like a being of the heavens and less a mortal creature. The Dervish's skin takes on a porcelain perfection, her features become glorious to behold, and she sprouts (nonfunctional) feathered wings from her back.

While in this form, the Dervish and all allies within 20 feet of her are healed for an amount equal to her class level whenever she uses an [Enchantment] Skill. In addition, whenever she uses such a skill, she is subjected to the effect of either remove curse or greater dispel magic with her class level in place of her caster level, which only removes negative effects. This effect can only remove a single negative effect each time it triggers; if the Dervish suffers from more than one curse, the removed curse is determined randomly. "

"Channeling the divine energy of the Maiden of Pain, the Dervish undergoes a transformation, becoming more like the cold, cruel god from which she draws her power. The Dervish's features become twisted in cruel glee, chilling to look upon. A nearly opaque shroud of shadows surrounds her, taking on the appearance of a ragged cloak threaded with obsidian barbs and spikes.

While in this form, the Dervish's attacks steal additional health from struck foes equal to her class level. Whenever an [Enchantment] Skill ends on the Dervish, all adjacent foes must succeed on a Fortitude save or contract the wailing torment disease. No creature may be forced to save against this effect more than once per round.

Wailing Torment:Supernatural disease - special application, no save to resist effects after initial application. Incubation period 1 round, damage repeats at beginning of each round thereafter. Damage equal to Dervish class level. While afflicted by this disease, a creature wails helplessly in anguish, unable to control their own voice. Any creature attempting to cast a spell with a vocal component while afflicted by this disease suffers a 50% failure chance."

"Channeling the divine energy of the Forest Queen, the Dervish undergoes a transformation, becoming more like the very trees and plants of the forest. The Dervish's skin takes on a barklike quality, blurring her features. Small twigs sprout from her flesh, instantly budding with green shoots that become leaves a heartbeat later.

While in this form, the Dervish loses any armor bonus to AC she may have had, but adds that bonus +1 to her natural armor score. Enhancement bonuses to armor converted to natural armor stack with her enhancement bonus to natural armor for the duration of this form. The Dervish gains temporary hitpoints equal to her class level, heavy fortification, and immunity to disease and poison.

Whenever an [Enchantment] Skill ends on the Dervish, all allies within 20 feet of the Dervish lose one randomly determined disease or poison currently affecting them."

"Channeling the divine energy of the Mother of all Magic, the Dervish undegoes a transformation, taking on many aspects of magic itself. The Dervish's skin, hair, and eyes shift color constantly, following no set pattern or racial possibility. Crackles of arcana leap between the Dervish's fingers, run along her limbs, and sparkle in her eyes. When she speaks, she does so in a voice that sounds like a thousand different variations of the same person.

While in this form, damage done by the Dervish's melee attacks is replaced by arcane damage, [Enchantment] Skills used by the Dervish recharge in half the normal time, and the Dervish gains 1 energy for each foe within her threatened range whenever an [Enchantment] Skill ends on her."

"Channeling the divine energy of the Lord of Battles, the Dervish undergoes a transformation, taking on the appearance of a heavily armored warrior. Spectral versions of gleaming mithral armor pieces surround her body, then solidify, though they retain their weightless nature. Though hard to see past her helm, the Dervish's features become wary yet calm, as a seasoned warrior before a great battle.

The Dervish treats her base armor as full plate, even if she was wearing no armor, except that she is still considered to be wearing whatever category of armor she truly wears. Only the armor bonus to AC increases; armor check penalties, speed penalties, arcane spell failure, and so on do not change. The Dervish gains DR/- equal to half her Dervish level and gains an additional strike of adrenaline whenever she would gain adrenaline.

Whenever an [Enchantment] Skill ends on the Dervish, all adjacent foes must succeed on a Will save or be ignited for one round."
